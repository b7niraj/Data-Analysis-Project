Worked on a dataset from Lopez, Miller and Graham Ltd., where I performed a comprehensive analysis to uncover key business insights from their sales data.

🔍 What I Did:

- Cleaned and preprocessed the data for accuracy

- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and pandas

- Identified sales trends by region, product line, and customer type

- Visualized key metrics using matplotlib and seaborn

- Highlighted potential business opportunities based on customer patterns

- Recorded a detailed walkthrough video explaining each step
